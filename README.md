# Synesthizer (Work in Progress)
Synesthesia is a rare phenomenon in where one of the body's senses involuntarily and automatically triggers another of the body's senses. For those who, like myself, have Chromesthesia, hearing sounds like music will trigger a strong experience of color. Some see colors project outside of themselves and some seeing colors only in their mind's eye. This application was created as a fun and interactive way to demonstrate what it's like to have Chromesthesia.  

## Quick Overview
The app consists of four modules (Synth, Drum, Bass, and Master Control) that the user can manipulate to generate musical sound. Each one is left unlabeled to encourage intuitive exploration rather than overwhelming the user with a bunch of words.  Once sound is created, a visual display will be generated that will dance and change color based on the music being played.
